Section 3: Understanding company growth and decline
Marketing team is interested in understanding the growth and decline pattern of the company in terms of new leads or sales amount by the customers.

3.1) Identify the total growth on an year by year basis

a. Based on Quantity of paint that's sold
SELECT *
FROM (
SELECT year_purchase, Total_Quantity AS Total_Quantity_2022, 
LAG(Total_Quantity) OVER(ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_1,
LAG(Total_Quantity,2) OVER(ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_2,
LAG(Total_Quantity,3) OVER(ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_3
FROM(
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate) AS year_purchase,
SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Quantity 
FROM CustomerTransactionData
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate) < 2023
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate)) AS T) AS T
WHERE year_purchase = 2022;

b. Based on amount of paint that's sold
SELECT *
FROM (
SELECT year_purchase, Total_Purchase AS Total_Purchase_2022, 
LAG(Total_Purchase) OVER(ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_1,
LAG(Total_Purchase,2) OVER(ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_2,
LAG(Total_Purchase,3) OVER(ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_3
FROM(
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate) AS year_purchase,
SUM(PurchasingAmt) AS Total_Purchase
FROM CustomerTransactionData
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate) < 2023
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate)) AS T) AS T
WHERE year_purchase = 2022;

c. Customers that's acquired [New + Repeated]
SELECT *
FROM (
SELECT year_purchase, NewUsers AS NewUsers_2022, 
LAG(NewUsers) OVER(ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_1,
LAG(NewUsers,2) OVER(ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_2,
LAG(NewUsers,3) OVER(ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_3
FROM(
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate) AS year_purchase,
COUNT(DISTINCT Cust_Id) AS NewUsers
FROM CustomerTransactionData
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate) < 2023
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate)) AS T) AS T
WHERE year_purchase = 2022;

d. Segregate the above By OrderType 
SELECT *
FROM (
SELECT year_purchase, OrderType,
  NewUsers AS NewUsers_2022, 
LAG(NewUsers) OVER(PARTITION BY OrderType ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_1,
LAG(NewUsers,2) OVER(PARTITION BY OrderType ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_2,
LAG(NewUsers,3) OVER(PARTITION BY OrderType ORDER BY year_purchase) AS pastoffset_3
FROM(
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate) AS year_purchase,
  OrderType,
COUNT(DISTINCT Cust_Id) AS NewUsers
FROM CustomerTransactionData
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate) < 2023
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM PurchaseDate), OrderType) AS T) AS T
WHERE year_purchase = 2022;
Based on the above results, we can see that the overall growth has declined in the past 1 year compared to recent years. It's very apparent from total quantities sold, total sales as well as customers acquired.
